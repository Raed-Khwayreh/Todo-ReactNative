# Todo-ReactNative
Simple todo app using react native
## 
In This project I have used:

2-Gesture handler

3-Bottom navigation bar

4- Async local storage

You can move between tasks pages using bottom navigation bar, and you can add,edit delete tasks.
And from app bar you can press plus icon to add new task.
