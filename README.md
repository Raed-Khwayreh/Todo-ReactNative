# Todo-ReactNative
Simple todo app using react native
## 
In This project I have used:

1-Redux
2-Gesture handler
3-Bottom navigation bar

##
You can move between tasks pages using bottom navigation bar, and you can add,edit delete tasks.
You can swipe the task left to delete it or swiper it to right to edit it.
And from app bar you can press plus icon to add new task.

##
Main screen that show all tasks
